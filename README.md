A Garmin watch IQ app designed for sailing

Three views:
Main - Shows time, current heading (both as number and as arrow on edge of screen), speed, position.
Target - Shows time, speed, and target (i.e., waypoint) information, including relative bearing (both as number and as arrow on edge of screen), bearing, and distance.
Timer - Race timer

Multiple targets can be loaded. Screens are rotated by pressing the up/down arrow keys.
Double-pressing (within 1 second) the run button sets a new target.
Single-pressing the run button on the target view opens menu. Choices are to stop following that target or save the target.
Holding the up button opens the main menu. Choices are to load a saved target or start the timer. 
Pressing the back button opens the exit menu. Choices are to Save and Exit or Discard and Exit.
All menus are designed with Back being the default option. This helps avoid choosing something you don't want to do when bumping the buttons, like during an active race.
Targets are saved to slots. Garmin limits the menu items, so only 15 slots are available at this time.
Activity recording starts automatically when the unit gets a (marginal) location fix.
If the timer is already running, starting it will reset it. The time is currently hard coded to 5 minutes.

Currently the layouts are designed for the Garmin Forerunner 235.  Layouts for other Garmin watches are planned for the future (please feel free to send me a request).
